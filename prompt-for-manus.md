# The prompt I used:

> i want to get rid of telegram. but some idiots still use it. i want to write a daemon that will be hosted on some vps, that will connect to telegram server using my id, pretend it's me, listen to messages, ignore messages from non-contacts, and respond with a predefined message to contacts informing them of other ways of contacting me. i hate python, prefer golang. use gotd library.
